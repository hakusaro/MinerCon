Hopefully, that shouldn't be too long now!\r\n\r\n## Open Source Licenses\r\n\r\nThis project uses parts of [rcon-client](https://code.google.com/p/rcon-client/) in order to communicate with Minecraft. Source modifications are available in the source tree.\r\n\r\n## Other Resources\r\n\r\nThis project uses [Android Icons](http://www.androidicons.com/) in several places. The icons used here are only for usage inside MinerCon. If you like them, buy yourself a pack and support the design team behind them.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
